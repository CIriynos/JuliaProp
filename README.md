# Welcome to use JuliaProp!

JuliaProp is a toolbox for solving Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation (TDSE), mainly based on finite difference method. JuliaProp is named after Qprop, a widely-used software in strong field physics or attophysics.

JuliaProp is developed with Julia, a modern lauguage that has many advantages in mathmatics or numerical simulation. Therefore, this toolbox benefits a lot from Julia, and we will show it in detailed as followed.

# Features
1. Flexibility. You can modify or create your own code based on specific question, and it is easy to extend the code.
2. Speed. With the enhancement of algorithm itself and the application of parallel programming, it has a significant improvement in efficiency and acurracy.
3. Easy-to-use. When you use JuliaProp, you may feel like you are using Python of MATLAB. The affinity of mathmatics gives users the best experience of coding.
4. Readability. All of the code are well organized and maintained (I wish so). The variables are easy to distinguish. And the documents are also well established. (But still in progress.)
